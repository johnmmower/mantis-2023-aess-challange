Welcome to the repository for the [Mantis team](#team) for the 2024 IEEE AESS Radar Challenge.

## Mission

Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar, ISAR, is a technique for creating images from radar data. ISAR is similar to SAR in that it employs relative motion between a radar and targets or scenes to form large synthetic apertures leading to fine azimuthal resolution. SAR and ISAR differ in that ISAR uses a stationary radar to image moving targets, while SAR uses radar motion to image (typically) stationary scenes. While SAR can typically take advantage of onboard sensors for motion estimation of the radar platform, such as a GPS or INS, ISAR must use various signal processing techniques to estimate, compensate, and take advantage of target motion.

We created an ISAR system that can be placed onshore and act as a low-cost monitoring system for an onshore team looking to observe water traffic. The benefit of this system over an optical system is that it works even in poor visibility conditions, such fog and darkness. It also has the potential to extend into a classification system, where it identifies the type of boat being tracked.

To take advantage of the Phaser CN0566 for a FMCW radar, we used a 500 MHz bandwidth chirp generated by the onboard ADF4159 synthesizer (swept from 12.0 to 12.5 GHz) and 2.15 GHz IF. Transmit from the PLUTO-SDR a positive 500kHz tone at the 2.2 GHz IF with 9.85 – 10.35 GHz chirp at the RF output. The transmit antenna was set up forward of the receive array for as much direct-path isolation as possible. Receive data was be calibrated, channel-summed, and packetized based on triggering from the logic interrupt of the ADF4159, and made available for archive off-device.

The radar system engineer’s role is to identify and consider a large trade-space of possibilities and we found that the CN0566 kit could be used for our system despite some obvious and not-so-obvious limitations. The primary concern to consider is that for scanning in azimuth, the radar operates with a vertical polarization and that this is typically avoided for sea operations as the clutter return is higher for low grazing angles. In our use case, we will only rarely encounter significant sea-states and high-winds, therefore the polarization issue of sea clutter will be suppressed. A second limitation is the bandwidth of the receiver, both in maximal bandwidth of the PLUTO-SDR’s AD9363 as well as streaming USB data rates. Both of these bandwidth limitations cause concern, the first limiting the resolvable target velocity and the second reducing average power for a continuous or almost-continuous radar. Ultimately, for our test location, our clutter cross-section was low and target cross-section was high, as well as along-range velocity was low.
